# MERN Stack Web Development Project

This project was my first basic fullstack web development build, utilizing the **MERN stack**â€”MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. It's a foundational learning experience where I've implemented essential components of a modern web application.

## Features

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to manage and store application data.
- **Express.js**: Backend web framework to handle routing and API requests.
- **React**: Frontend library for building interactive and dynamic user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: Server-side runtime environment that powers the backend.

I look forward to applying these learned skills to building projects of my own!
